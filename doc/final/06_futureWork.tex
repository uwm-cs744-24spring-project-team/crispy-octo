\section{Future Work}

This project has explored the co-location of Spark batch jobs alongside simulated workloads. Moving forward, it is necessary to expand the scope of experimentation to include simulations of real-life workload data, such as those from Microsoft Philly traces~\cite{jeon_analysis_2019}, and to validate these simulations with actual applications. Additionally, the scope should be broadened to incorporate a more diverse range of workloads to thoroughly assess the benefits and effectiveness of over-committing resources. Lastly, evaluating this strategy in larger-scale systems will provide valuable insights, as these systems offer greater potential for over-committing services.
